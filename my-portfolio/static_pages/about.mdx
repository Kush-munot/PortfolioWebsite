Hey, I am Kush Munot. A Front-end Developer/React Developer from India who loves to design and code. I use React.js or Next.js to build the web application interfaces and the functionalities. At the moment, I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

The first programming language I learned was C. Since then, I have also learned Python. I also played around with databases, but Firebase is my favorite right now.


Aside from coding, I love reading books and cooking as well. I don't have the time or really any interest in playing video games these days. However, I also enjoy watching movies and web series whenever I have the chance. 

If you were to ask me what stack I would prefer, I would say 

- Framework - React.js
- Database : Firebase
- UI Library - Material UI 

You can do anything you can think of with these three things. I have done two paid Internships into early stage Startups as Full Stack Developer. I prefer making projects with my team and friends. I am also the President of a growing College Community called Geeks For Geeks RCOEM Chapter.


I love my work and enjoy each and every project as I get it. Feel free to look at my portfolio and don't hesitate to contact me.
